# FAQ

## Is Empathy Spot for me?

If you are a student of Compassionate Communication, a.k.a. [Nonviolent Communication (NVC)](http://www.nycnvc.org/our-work/), Empathy Spot is being designed for you. But in order to fully participate, you will first need some form of in-person connection with a certified NVC trainer.
