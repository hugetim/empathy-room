## Vision

To make it possible to find someone to exchange empathy with via videochat at any time, in a way that empowers NVC trainers and reinforces in-person communities.

## Current Status

The prototype for Empathy Spot is in an "alpha" phase of development and testing. [Click here to receive an email when Empathy Spot becomes open to the public.](http://eepurl.com/gAHrFT) 

## FAQ

### Is Empathy Spot for me?

* If you are a student of Compassionate Communication, a.k.a. [Nonviolent Communication (NVC)](http://www.nycnvc.org/our-work/), Empathy Spot is designed for you, particularly if you are connected with a certified NVC trainer. 
* If you are an NVC trainer, Empathy Spot is especially meant to support your work. 
* And if someone already participating in Empathy Spot has invited you, welcome, you're in the right place! 
* For others, Empathy Spot is not really intended for you, at least at this point. Instead, the next step may be to connect with a local [event](https://www.cnvc.org/trainings), [trainer](https://www.cnvc.org/trainers), or [community](https://www.cnvc.org/trainings/practice-groups) to learn how to exchange empathy in the "NVC" way.

### Why not let everyone use it?

Empathy Spot is not designed to teach people how to exchange empathy, and it also requires some form of gatekeeping to discourage unintended uses. So the idea, currently, is that NVC trainers will vouch for their students, authorizing them to match with any other member to exchange empathy. Each member, in turn, will be able to invite guests to a personal group, allowing them to match with others in that group (but not the wider membership, unless vouched for by an NVC trainer).
