## Vision

To make it possible to find someone to exchange empathy with via videochat at any time, in a way that empowers NVC trainers and reinforces in-person communities.

## Current Status

The prototype for Empathy Spot is in an "alpha" phase of development and testing. [Click here to receive an email when Empathy Spot becomes open to the public.](http://eepurl.com/gAHrFT) 

## FAQ

### Is Empathy Spot for me?

* If you are a student of Compassionate Communication, a.k.a. [Nonviolent Communication (NVC)](http://www.nycnvc.org/our-work/), Empathy Spot is being designed for you, particularly if you are already connected with a certified NVC trainer. 
* If you are an NVC trainer, Empathy Spot is especially made to support and empower you. 
* And if someone already participating in Empathy Spot has invited you, welcome, you're in the right place! 
* For others, Empathy Spot is not really intended for you, at least at this point. Instead, the next step may be to connect with a local [event](https://www.cnvc.org/trainings), [trainer](https://www.cnvc.org/trainers), or [community](https://www.cnvc.org/trainings/practice-groups) to learn how to exchange empathy in the "NVC" way.

### Why not let everyone use it?

Well, it is not designed to teach people how to exchange empathy. So the current idea is that NVC trainers will register their students, vouching for their ability to exchange empathy. Everyone registered that way, including by different trainers, will be able to match with each other. And students, in turn, will have a more limited ability to invite others to their personal groups (which will be able to match with each other but not the wider community, unless they are vouched for themselves by an NVC trainer).
